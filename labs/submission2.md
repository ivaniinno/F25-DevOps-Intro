## 🛠 Lab-Based Learning Experience

**80% of your grade comes from hands-on labs** — each designed to build real-world skills:

1. **Lab Structure**

   * Task-oriented challenges with clear objectives
   * Safe environments using containers or local VMs

2. **Submission Workflow**

   * Fork course repository → Create lab branch → Complete tasks
   * Push to fork → Open Pull Request → Receive feedback & evaluation

3. **Grading Advantage**

   * **Perfect Lab Submissions (10/10)**: Exam exemption + bonus points
   * **On-Time Submissions (≥6/10)**: Guaranteed pass (C or higher)
   * **Late Submissions**: Maximum 6/10

---

## 📊 Evaluation Framework

*Transparent assessment for skill validation*

### Grade Composition

* Labs (10 × 8 points each): **80%**
* Final Exam (comprehensive): **20%**

### Performance Tiers

* **A (90-100)**: Mastery of core concepts, innovative solutions
* **B (75-89)**: Consistent completion, minor improvements needed
* **C (60-74)**: Basic competency, needs reinforcement
* **D (0-59)**: Fundamental gaps, re-attempt required

---

## ✅ Success Path

> *"Complete all labs with ≥6/10 to pass. Perfect lab submissions grant exam exemption and bonus points toward an A."*

feat: add second line to obejct test


### Explanation:
- **Blob**: Stores the actual file content as a binary object
- **Tree**: Represents a directory structure, listing files and subdirectories with their permissions and object hashes
- **Commit**: Contains metadata about the commit including author, date, message, and references to tree and parent commits


## Task 2 - Reset and Reflog Recovery

### Commands Used:
- `git log --oneline` - Showed commit logs
- `git status` - Showed current files status
- `git reset --soft HEAD~1` - Moved HEAD back one commit, kept changes staged
- `git status` - Showed current files status
- `git log --oneline` - Showed commit logs
- `git reset --hard HEAD~1` - Moved HEAD back one commit, discarded all changes
- `git status` - Showed current files status
- `git log --oneline` - Showed commit logs
- `git reflog` - Showed history of HEAD movements
- `git reset --hard <reflog_hash>` (97c2eb1) - Recovered to previous state
- `git log --oneline` - Showed commit logs
