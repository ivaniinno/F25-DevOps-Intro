feat: add second line to obejct test


### Explanation:
- **Blob**: Stores the actual file content as a binary object
- **Tree**: Represents a directory structure, listing files and subdirectories with their permissions and object hashes
- **Commit**: Contains metadata about the commit including author, date, message, and references to tree and parent commits


## Task 2 - Reset and Reflog Recovery

- `git log --oneline` - Showed commit logs
- `git status` - Showed current files status
- `git reset --soft HEAD~1` - Moved HEAD back one commit, kept changes staged
- `git status` - Showed current files status
- `git log --oneline` - Showed commit logs
- `git reset --hard HEAD~1` - Moved HEAD back one commit, discarded all changes
- `git status` - Showed current files status
- `git log --oneline` - Showed commit logs
- `git reflog` - Showed history of HEAD movements
- `git reset --hard <reflog_hash>` (97c2eb1) - Recovered to previous state
- `git log --oneline` - Showed commit logs

## Task 3 - Visualize Commit History

### Commands Used:
- `git switch -c side-branch` - Created and switched to side branch
- `git switch -` - Switched back to previous branch
- `git log --oneline --graph --all` - Showed visual commit graph

### Graph Output:
```
* 0cb3052 (side-branch) Side branch commit
| * 97c2eb1 (git-reset-practice) Second commit
| * a075075 First commit
|/  
* 9815971 (HEAD -> feature/lab2) feat: add second line to obejct test

```

### Commit Messages:
- Side branch commit
- Second commit
- First commit
- feat: add second line to obejct test
- feat: add object test file
- Merge branch 'inno-devops-labs:main' into main
- feat: publish lec2
- feat: publish lab2
- Update README.md
- docs: add commit signing summary
- docs: add PR template
- feat: update lab1

- Publish lec1
- Publish README.md

### Reflection:
The graph visualization helps understand branch relationships and commit history by showing how branches diverge and merge, making it easier to track the development flow and identify where changes originated.


## Task 4 - Tagging Commits

### Commands Used:
- `git tag v1.0.0` - Created lightweight tag
- `git push origin v1.0.0` - Pushed tag to remote

### Tag Information:
- **v1.0.0**: 9815971 - Initial version

### Why Tags Matter:
Tags are crucial for versioning as they mark specific points in history for releases, trigger CI/CD pipelines, and help create release notes. They provide stable references to specific code states.


## Task 5 - git switch vs git checkout vs git restore

### Commands Used:
- `git switch -c cmd-compare` - Modern branch creation and switching
- `git branch` - Show all branches and point by * to the current one
- `git switch -` - Toggle between branches to the previous one
- `git branch` - Show all branches and point by * to the current one
- `git checkout -b cmd-compare-2` - Legacy branch creation
- `git branch` - Show all branches and point by * to the current one

- `echo "scratch" >> demo.txt` - Append to the "demo.txt" and create if if not yet
- `git add demo.txt` - Add "demo.txt"
- `git commit -m "feat: add demo file for testing"` - Commit "demo.txt"
- `git status` - Show the status on files after commiting "demo.txt"
- `git restore demo.txt` - Discard working tree changes
- `git status` - Show the status on files after restoring "demo.txt"
- `echo "staged content" >> demo.txt` - Append new changes
- `git add demo.txt` - Add new "demo.txt"
- `git status` - Show the status after updating "demo.txt"
- `git restore --staged demo.txt` - Unstage file
- `git status` - Show the status after unstaging
- `git restore --source=HEAD~1 demo.txt` - Restore from specific commit, i.e., delete demo.txt
- `git status` - Show final file status (deleted)

### When to Use Each:
- **git switch**: Use for branch operations (create, switch, delete branches) - it's explicit and clear
- **git checkout**: Legacy command that's overloaded - avoid for new workflows
- **git restore**: Use for file restoration operations - it's specific and unambiguous
