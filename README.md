## ðŸ›  Lab-Based Learning Experience

**80% of your grade comes from hands-on labs** â€” each designed to build real-world skills:

1. **Lab Structure**

   * Task-oriented challenges with clear objectives
   * Safe environments using containers or local VMs

2. **Submission Workflow**

   * Fork course repository â†’ Create lab branch â†’ Complete tasks
   * Push to fork â†’ Open Pull Request â†’ Receive feedback & evaluation

3. **Grading Advantage**

   * **Perfect Lab Submissions (10/10)**: Exam exemption + bonus points
   * **On-Time Submissions (â‰¥6/10)**: Guaranteed pass (C or higher)
   * **Late Submissions**: Maximum 6/10

---

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Framework

*Transparent assessment for skill validation*

### Grade Composition

* Labs (10 Ã— 8 points each): **80%**
* Final Exam (comprehensive): **20%**

### Performance Tiers

* **A (90-100)**: Mastery of core concepts, innovative solutions
